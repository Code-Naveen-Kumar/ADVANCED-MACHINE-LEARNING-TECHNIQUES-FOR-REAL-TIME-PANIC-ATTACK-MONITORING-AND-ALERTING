# ADVANCED-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES-FOR-REAL-TIME-PANIC-ATTACK-MONITORING-AND-ALERTING
Developed a system that uses wearable devices data's and machine learning to early predict and alert for panic attacks by analyzing real-time EEG images and physiological metrics, addressing the need for immediate intervention and personalized health guidance.

# Panic Attack Detection System Using Wearable Devices

## Aim
To create an advanced system for early detection and monitoring of physiological signals, alerting users and their close ones to signs of panic attacks. By combining EfficientNet and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms, the system analyzes real-time data such as blood pressure, body temperature, and heart rate, along with EEG reports, to improve accuracy and effectively identify indicators of panic attacks.

## Importance of Early Detection
1. **Prevention of Escalation**
2. **Mental Health Management**
3. **Physical Health Protection**
4. **Improved Intervention**

## Problem Formulation
The goal is to develop a system that utilizes data from wearable devices and machine learning to predict and alert users about panic attacks by analyzing real-time EEG images and physiological metrics, addressing the need for immediate intervention and personalized health guidance.

Traditional mental health monitoring often relies on self-reporting and clinical assessments, which lack real-time detection and may overlook panic attacks, potentially leading to the escalation of anxiety disorders.

## Proposed Solution
This project provides a proactive solution by continuously monitoring physiological data through machine learning. Real-time alerts and interventions are designed to prevent the escalation of panic episodes and support mental health management.

## Conclusion & Future Work
The system successfully detects panic attacks with high accuracy. Real-time monitoring and alerts offer a proactive approach to managing panic attacks, enabling continuous and effective health data monitoring through the integration of wearable health devices and machine learning algorithms.

### Future Work
Future development may include:
- Further algorithm optimization for higher accuracy
- Integration with additional biometric data (e.g., ECG or respiration rate)
- Exploration of advanced wearable devices with additional sensors

This system has potential for large-scale mental health applications and could be integrated with telemedicine platforms for immediate professional assistance. Expanding and enhancing this system offers the possibility of providing personalized, real-time mental health support to users, particularly those experiencing anxiety or panic disorders.
